Calendar
==========

The calendar function is very small and it contains only 2 lines of code since we are using the library of tkcalendar which does all the job for us to show the calendar

.. code-block:: python

    cal = Calendar(calendar_frame)
    cal.grid()
========

the first line gets the calendar and places in our tkinter frame and the second line make it show up on the Gui app
