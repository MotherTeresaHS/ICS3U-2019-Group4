Before doing anything else, you should format your sd card and install the latest version of Raspian onto it. This ensures you have a clean build with all the latest updates and no leftover files floating around. Rasberry has an excellent quick start guide `here <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/>`_ to step you through the process of getting the latest version of raspian onto your pi.

Just a reminder, if you are having any problems loading Raspian onto your Pi, ensure that you are using the right programs and a functional micro sd card. Once the Raspian is all loaded, come on back to continue the tutorial.
